      <p class="section-body">
        During my Junior year, me and a friend had an assigment to make a game.
        We decided on a street fighter inspired game, with world leaders.
        We primarily did this due to finding it hilarous, along with 
        making it have a bit of political satire.
      </p>
      <p class="section-body">
        The main goal of the game was to get the basic fighting working
        working. This was our first time using Godot, so we also focused
        on learning the programming language.

            Me and my friend Isaac Zhang decided to team up. We become friends
            in 3rd grade, and have worked together in multiple app academy
            projects. We have also worked on many hobby and school projects
            including things such as Minecraft maps and group projects.

            While creating the UI, Isaac had requested the stats of defense,
            hp, and ultimate progress.
            Defense would be used for shielding damage, hp for taking damage
            and ultimate progess to show when you can use it.
