        A Street Fighter inspired fighting game. It was intended to have various world leaders and political figures, but only Xi Xing Ping was implemented. Built using the Godot Engine in GDScript.

      <p class="section-body">
        During my Junior year, me and a friend had an assigment to make a game.
        We decided on a street fighter inspired game, with world leaders.
        We primarily did this due to finding it hilarous, along with 
        making it have a bit of political satire.

      <p class="section-body">
        The main goal of the hackathon was in order to get procedural generation
        working. We were given a basic item and player, so we built off that.
        Due to previous experience in Godot, we decided to use it to code.

            Me and my friend Isaac Zhang decided to team up. We become friends
            in 3rd grade, and have worked together in multiple app academy
            projects. We have also worked on many hobby and school projects
            including things such as Minecraft maps and group projects.

            I was sent to be the primary sprite artist, and create items.
            I created the basic character and spritesheet, with over 40
            animation sprites. I then created the alternative character,
            and made multiple enemy sprites. Lastly I worked on the UI
            and items.

            The hackathon required us to build a game, presenting the options of
            top down or side scroller. We decided on top down, and got to drafting
            In order to fit the summer theme, we intended to have multiple 
            dungeons, each in a island or "rest area" of sorts.

      <p class="section-body">
        We started off with the starter repository, then started off on the
        procedural generation. We originally got it worked with a map of sorts
        , but not rooms. Due to time restraints the generation only included
        one type of room, but that is a work in progress.

      <p class="section-body">
        The next step was to add life to the dungeon, with enemies and items.
        While Eric worked on coding enemies, I created sprites for him and
        coded the UI.

            Unfortuntely, we encountered many obstucles on our journey.
            The first issue started off as the guide we used was in a
            different version of godot, which significant changes.
            Issues persisted, but were eventually solved. The next
            major issue involved Eric's enemy. The enemy's code did
            not work on anyone else's computer, even though we used
            the same version.<br /><br />
            We decided to upload the work and go home. We had decided
            to continue our work there. However, Isaac's computer had
            an issue uploading, but luckily he was able to sort it out.
            <br /><br />
            Thankfully, at our houses the coding went smoothly. We
            finished the procedural generation, and created a weapon.

            While creating the UI, we had to think of what to put on it.
            We decided on having the stats of health, stamina, and mana.
            Health would be used to take damage, stamina for sprinting, and
            mana for spells. I created multiple iterations, before settling
            on three final designs (seen in the picture). Here we chose the
            one best suited towards the style of the dungeon.
