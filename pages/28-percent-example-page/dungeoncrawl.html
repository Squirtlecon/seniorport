      <p class="PH-desc">
        A basic dungeon crawler game with procedural generation. Enemies are not yet implemented, as it is a work in progress. Originally built for a hackathon. Built using the Godot Engine in GDScript.

      <p class="section-body">
        During March of 2024, I participated in an school hackathon with some
        friends. We had decided towards doing a dungeon crawler with random
        generation, in order to give high replayability. We intended to add
        various enemies, items and npcs. In order to fit the summer theme,
        we intended to have multiple dungeons, each in a island or "rest area"
        of sorts.
      </p>
      <p class="section-body">
        The main goal of the hackathon was in order to get procedural generation
        working. We were given a basic item and player, so we built off that.
        Due to previous experience in Godot, we decided to use it to code.

            It started off with Isaac Zhang and I working together. Later on 
            Ellis Park joined us with much larger ambitions, which led to the
            addition of Eric Homer. Isaac had been assigned towards coding
            the procedural generation. Ellis had been assigned to creating
            tiles for the dungeons. Eric was assigned to working on music
            and enemies.

            I was sent to be the primary sprite artist, and create items.
            I created the basic character and spritesheet, with over 40
            animation sprites. I then created the alternative character,
            and made multiple enemy sprites. Lastly I worked on the UI
            and items.

            The grant required us to build a website that described the purpose
            of the project, the team, events, and project deliverables. We also
            needed a way for users to subscribe to the newsletter, find team
            meeting times and locations, and read current and past newsletters.

      <p class="section-body">
        Our layout designer worked on an initial prototype in Figma - working to
        design something that would meet three primary needs: sharing current
        and past newsletters, displaying information about the club, and
        allowing users to subscribe.
      </p>
      <p class="section-body">
        After going through a couple rounds, she presented this initial design
        to the rest of the team. There was a lot of positive feedback, as well
        as some good constructive points.

            A lot of the team liked the simplicity of the navigation menu and
            information architecure, noting it was really easy to find
            everything and navigate through the website. <br /><br />
            Team members also liked the use of a grid layout for past
            newsletters and how simple the subscribe feature was.
            <br /><br />
            But in terms of the color & typography choices, the team was
            divided.

            The designer explained she was trying to resemble the colors and
            style of a vintage newspaper. But other members argued that the
            colors should be more aligned with the newsletter brand colors -
            purples, blues, and greens. In a survey that our head of outreach
            posted on Instagram, the majority agreed to make the switch to a
            cooler color palette.

      <p class="section-body">
        For the final design, we kept some of the features from the initial
        design - such as the navigation bar, most of the navigation labels, and
        the simple subscription form. We also kept the grid layout to display
        past newsletters. <br />
        <br />
        We did change the color scheme to a combination of purples and blues,
        which better matched our other brand and social media materials. We
        added an additional page for events and moved the subscription form to
        the home page.
        <br />
        <br />
        The website was built in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form posts the
        submitted emails to a google sheets, using a custom API built using the
        platform SheetDb. The website is deployed through Vercel.
